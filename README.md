# Tissue_Loading_Simulator
# Tissue Adaptation Simulator

This project is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that simulates the likely net effect of different exercise loading parameters on the adaptation (strength/properties) of Muscle, Tendon, and Bone tissue.

## Description

The application allows users to adjust various loading parameters commonly associated with exercise protocols, such as:

*   Exercise Type (Resistance Training, Running, Jumping, Sedentary, etc.)
*   Intensity / Load (% 1RM or RPE)
*   Volume (Reps, Sets, Duration)
*   Frequency
*   Effort Level (for Resistance Training)

Based on the selected parameters, the app provides a visual indication (Increase, Maintain, Decrease, Potential Risk) and a brief explanation for the expected adaptive response of muscle, tendon, and bone, drawing upon general principles outlined in exercise physiology research summaries.

## Features

*   Interactive sliders and dropdowns for easy parameter adjustment.
*   Real-time feedback on the potential effects on Muscle, Tendon, and Bone.
*   Simple explanations for the predicted tissue responses based on the input parameters.
*   Clear visual indicators (icons and text) for the adaptation status.

## Prerequisites

*   Python (version 3.7 or higher recommended)
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name)*

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the Streamlit application:

1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run tissue_app.py
    ```
3.  The application should automatically open in your default web browser. If not, the terminal will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) to open manually.
4.  Adjust the parameters in the sidebar and observe the predicted tissue responses.

## Disclaimer

**This application is a simplified educational tool based on general physiological principles summarized from research literature. It does *not* provide medical advice or personalized training recommendations.**

Individual responses to exercise can vary significantly based on genetics, training history, nutrition, recovery, health status, and many other factors. The underlying logic simplifies complex biological processes.

**Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals (like doctors or physical therapists) or certified fitness professionals before starting or modifying any exercise program.** Do not rely solely on this simulation for making decisions about your training or health.
